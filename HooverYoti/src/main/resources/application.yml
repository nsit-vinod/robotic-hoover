#for hiding the properties that are in plain text we can use Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) 
#java liberary which allow developer to add basic encryption capabilities to his/her projects with minimum effort.
#In the application.properties (or yaml), we will write our encrypted properties between parenthesis and put ENC
# keyword before it. Like; password=ENC(23ClLWiedLx8v6XT6Wk+Bg==)
#We can use encrypt.bat or encrypt.sh in jasypt/bin folder to encrypt properties in yml file.
#D:\jasypt\bin>encrypt.bat input MBcoder password=secret
#There are several algorithms to pick but I will leave it as default and only give my property value and secret to encrpyt it
#We can give it as a command line argument when running the application;
#â€“jasypt.encryptor.password=secret
